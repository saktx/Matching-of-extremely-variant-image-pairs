# Matching-of-extremely-variant-image-pairs
This repository provides the MATLAB Code (which uses MEX files of OpenCV Library) for Matching 10 Extremely Variant Image Pairs. This code was used for experiments in the research paper entitled: **"Potential of SIFT, SURF, KAZE, AKAZE, ORB, BRISK, AGAST, and 7 More Algorithms for Matching Extremely Variant Image Pairs"**. 

The code uses "full potential" of 14 feature detection algorithms by using their extremely low parameter thresholds. In this way, matching of extremely deteriorated images with their originals becomes robust.

The 14 feature detectors are: SIFT, SURF, KAZE, AKAZE, ORB, BRISK, AGAST, FAST, MSER, MSD, GFTT, Harris Corner Detector based GFTT, Harris Laplace Detector, Star Detector, and CenSurE.

The extremely variant image pairs represent 10 types of different deteriorations due to: extreme dust, smoke, darkness (dim light), extreme noise, motion-blur, extreme affine, JPEG compression, occlusion, sunlight/shadow, and decoration using light effects.

## Important Instructions
To run the code, download all the **.m** and **.mat** files (together with 10 image pairs) in **same folder**, and the execute the code...

**Code_Full_Potential.m** is the main (primary) code file which uses feature detectors with extremely low thresholds, for robust performance...

**Code_with_Default_Thresholds.m** is the secondary code file which uses feature detectors with default (normal) thresholds...
The "full potential performance" and the "normal performance" of the 14 feature detectors can be compared by running these 2 code files separately...

**analyseFeatureDetector.m** is a function which finds repeatability of the feature detector in use...
**flannNNDRBasedMatching.m** is a function which applies Nearest-Neighbor-Distance-Ratio (NNDR) based descriptor matching using FLANN...
**keypoint.mat** is a file used in the main code for improving computational efficiency while mapping keypoints to/from struct format...
