# Matching-of-extremely-variant-image-pairs
This repository provides the MATLAB Code (which uses MEX files of OpenCV Library) for Matching 10 Extremely Variant Image Pairs. This code was used for experiments in the research paper entitles: "Potential of SIFT, SURF, KAZE, AKAZE, ORB, BRISK, AGAST, and 7 More Algorithms for Matching Extremely Variant Image Pairs".
