# Matching-of-extremely-variant-image-pairs
This repository provides the MATLAB Code (which uses MEX files of OpenCV Library) for Matching 10 Extremely Variant Image Pairs. This code was used for experiments in the research paper entitled: "Potential of SIFT, SURF, KAZE, AKAZE, ORB, BRISK, AGAST, and 7 More Algorithms for Matching Extremely Variant Image Pairs". 

The code uses "full potential" of 14 feature detection algorithms by using their extremely low parameter thresholds. In this way, matching of extremely deteriorated images with their original versions becomes robust.
