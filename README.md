# Matching-of-extremely-variant-image-pairs
This repository provides the MATLAB Code (which uses MEX files of OpenCV Library) for Matching 10 Extremely Variant Image Pairs. This code was used for experiments in the research paper entitled: **"Potential of SIFT, SURF, KAZE, AKAZE, ORB, BRISK, AGAST, and 7 More Algorithms for Matching Extremely Variant Image Pairs"**. 

<ins>This code will work only after setting up **mexopencv** with your MATLAB. To do so, follow the guidelines mentioned in the **Step-1, Step-2, and Step-3 Instruction files**</ins>.

The code uses "full potential" of 14 feature detection algorithms by using their extremely low parameter thresholds. In this way, matching of extremely deteriorated images with their originals becomes robust.

The 14 feature detectors are: <ins>SIFT, SURF, KAZE, AKAZE, ORB, BRISK, AGAST, FAST, MSER, MSD, GFTT, Harris Corner Detector based GFTT, Harris Laplace Detector, Star Detector, and CenSurE</ins>.

The extremely variant image pairs represent 10 types of different deteriorations due to: <ins>extreme dust, smoke, darkness (dim light), extreme noise, motion-blur, extreme affine, JPEG compression, occlusion, sunlight/shadow, and decoration using light effects</ins>.

## Important Instructions:
To run the code, download all the **.m** and **.mat** files (together with 10 image pairs) in **same folder**, and then execute the code...

<ins>This code will work only after setting up **mexopencv** with your MATLAB. To do so, follow the guidelines mentioned in the **Step-1, Step-2, and Step-3 Instruction files**</ins>.

You can downloading the 10 image pairs used in the research paper, from the link provided in **<ins>10 Extremely Variant Image Pairs.txt</ins>** file. The images with format/extension **.ppm** are openable in MATLAB using the image reading function i.e. **imread('affine1.ppm')**
